## About The Project
Welcome to RUSTCRAFT!
Rustcraft is a simple Minecraft engine written in rust using [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).

### But Why?

I wanted to work on a project to learn more about [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) as well as practice my Rust skills. I then randomly saw this youtube [video](https://youtu.be/4O0_-1NaWnY) and got inspired to try to make a simple Minecraft engine in Rust!

## Inspiration

As I explained I was inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/4O0_-1NaWnY) and the corresponding [codebase](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend). This is why you will probably see a lot of design similarities between my project and [this](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend) one. [Jdah](https://github.com/jdah), your video was awesome. (I also copied his blocks atlas because I liked it a lot).

## Current State

I am pretty happy with the current state of the engine. There are a few problems with it but they are outside of my MVP scope. I am aware that the game is not as efficient and smooth as it should be. I initially set as a goal to not use any threading or unsafe rust. Turns out it is hard to generate the world efficiently without any of that so I did end up eventually using [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) (but I should really be using [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)). This would require some not trivial redesign and maybe I will update this in the future ðŸ¤·.

The [noise](https://github.com/razaekel/noise-rs) library I am using is also a bit slow. There are some issues with integrating it nicely into a bigger project but I don't really want to write my own noise library right now so this works.

## Potential Updates

- [ ] Transparent water
- [ ] Lighting (real sun or "hacked" lighting)
- [ ] Block memory map (saves location of broken/placed blocks)
- [ ] Game physics
- [ ] additional sprites: (tree, flowers)
- [ ] Block selection during placement
- [ ] Biomes
- [ ] "Real" concurrency for chunk generation (Tokio).

## Prerequisites

- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Arguments

Running in wireframe mode:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -w
```

Running with coordinate system at [0,0,0] (for debugging):

```bash
cargo run --release -- -c
```

Running a flat world:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -f
```

### Running on Windows

On windows-msvc, make sure that you have a version of ninja.exe ([download here](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)) available in your PATH varaible.


### Controls

- `wasd` to move around
- `space` move upwards
- `shift` move down
- `left click` break block
- `right click` place block
